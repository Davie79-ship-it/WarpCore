Cacls.exe is a command-line utility included in Microsoft Windows, specifically designed for managing file and folder permissions within the Windows operating system, with the version 10.0.15063.0 being part of the Windows 10 suite. It allows users to view and modify access control lists (ACLs) for files and directories, enabling them to set permissions for different users and groups, which is crucial for maintaining system security and user privacy. As a legitimate Microsoft application, cacls.exe is considered safe and is not classified as a virus or malware; however, like any executable file, it can be misused by malicious software if placed in the wrong context or modified by an attacker. Users may encounter errors when using cacls.exe if they do not have the necessary administrative privileges or if the syntax of the command is incorrect, which can lead to access denials or other permission-related issues. It is important for users to ensure that they are using the command correctly and to verify the file's location, as malware can sometimes disguise itself with similar filenames.
